## Next.js on Compute@Edge

Deploy and serve your [https://nextjs.org](Next.js) website from Fastly's blazing-fast [Compute@Edge](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/).

## Usage

Use [https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started](`create-next-app`) or any normal method to set up your `Next.js` app.

Build your site normally as you would in Next.js, and use Next.js's built-in development server during
development:

```shell
yarn dev
```

or

```shell
npm run dev
```

When you're ready to deploy your site to Compute@Edge, build your site with the standard build tool:

```shell
yarn build
```

or

```shell
npm run build
````

This creates an optimized build of your application and places the output into the `./.next` directory,
that contains all the files generated from your sources.

To run this in Compute@Edge, run:

```shell
npx @fastly/next-compute-js init
```

This will generate a Compute@Edge project for you and place it in a `./compute-js` directory.

This program can then be [served (local development server)](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/testing/#running-a-local-testing-server)
or [published (to compute@edge service)](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/#deploy-the-project-to-a-new-fastly-service) by using the following commands.

Local Development:
```shell
cd ./compute-js
fastly compute serve
```

Deploy to Compute@Edge:
```shell
cd ./compute-js
fastly compute publish
```

Remember that if you ever change your source files, you will have to run `yarn build` (or `npm run build`) again to
update the built files in your `.next` directory.

## Scripts

In order to simplify the process of building and running or publishing your project, we recommend
that you add the following scripts to your `package.json` file.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "fastly-compute-serve": "next build && cd compute-js && fastly compute serve --verbose"
    "fastly-compute-publish": "next build && cd compute-js && fastly compute publish --verbose"
  }
}
```

Now, you can use the following commands to run or publish your project:

Local Development:
```shell
yarn fastly-compute-serve
```

Deploy to Compute@Edge:
```shell
yarn fastly-compute-publish
```

## Configuring the Compute@Edge application

Being a normal Compute@Edge JavaScript application, the generated project contains a
[https://developer.fastly.com/reference/compute/fastly-toml](`fastly.toml`) file.
Before publishing your project, you may want to update the various fields to specify
your project name, the author name, and the service ID.

Additionally, if the Server-Side parts of your application need any access to backends
while running on the local development server, define them here.

## How it works

Internally this is a custom implementation of the `NextServer` class provided by Next.js.
On instantiation, it uses [`@fastly/http-compute-js`](https://github.com/fastly/http-compute-js) to simulate Node.js's
request and response objects, and uses [`@fastly/compute-js-static-publish`](https://github.com/fastly/compute-js-static-publish)
to load up the files from the filesystem under the `./next` directory generated by `next build`.
